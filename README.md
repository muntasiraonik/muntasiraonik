👋 Hello, I'm Muntasir Ebna Helal! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here you'll find an assortment of projects, contributions, and possibly a bit of code magic. Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to get in touch.

## About Me ❓

I'm a passionate Aspiring Programmer with a bunch of projects. My journey in the world of technology and coding has been a rollercoaster of nerdiness. I love tackling projects that challenge me, allowing room for both learning and growing—yes, even making a mistake or two along the way. But who doesn't, right? 🚀

## Current Projects 👨🏻‍💻

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on or have recently completed:

1. **[Validate WordPress Theme License, Enable Updates, and Provide Theme Zip File]** - [Next Js]
    - Uploading the release zip file to the database.
    - Generating a unique license key for each domain name.
    - WordPress sends the license key, domain name, and theme version to the Next.js API endpoint.
    - At the validation API endpoint, it checks the license key, domain name, and status of the license. If everything matches, the license is marked as valid. It then compares the version. If a new version is available, it sends the zip file to WordPress, enabling the auto-update feature in WordPress.
